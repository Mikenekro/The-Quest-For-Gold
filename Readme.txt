Created as a school project. Took around 2.5 months to develop and around a week of bugfixing. Not all bugs were fixed and the project is uploaded here as it was submitted to my teacher.


The Quest For Gold instructions:

Installer: Installs the game on computer. Run the setup.exe (not .msi) to detect for dependencies.

Changing controls will not work in the final build (Change the XMLS here: My Documents/QuestForGold/GameData/Config)

Bugs:
Pressing "T" (Rest) in character creation menu will bring up the rest menu. Click cancel when this happens.
Changing the controls will not work if the build is not in the editors build folder. 
(You can edit the XML files in My Documents/QuestForGold/GameData/Config to change controls in the build)
Control prompts in-game will not change when you change the controls.
Random NPC bugs.
Random music bugs.
Location change bugs.
Some other unknown bugs.
Some other known bugs.


Hidden Controls:
Shift + (Space or Left Mouse Button) = Power Attack
Shift + (W, A, S, D) = Run
Hover mouse cursor over enemy + 'E' = Talk
'T' = Wait for some time

The rest of the controls you can find in the Options menu in game.
